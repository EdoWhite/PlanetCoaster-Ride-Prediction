# PlanetCoaster Ride Rating Prediction
This is a Data Science and Machine Learning project regarding roller coasters rides that can be created in a famous game: Planet Coaster.
This game uses an AI to rate the user-created rides, this rating influences different aspects of the game. Buildin good rides it's important and knowing in advance if a ride will be good rated in the game can be usefull. The main goal of this project is to **predict the rating of a new ride in Planet Coaster before actually building it.**

**In the jupyter notebook it is reported the _complete project_ with descriptions and comments.**

## Main Steps of the Project
